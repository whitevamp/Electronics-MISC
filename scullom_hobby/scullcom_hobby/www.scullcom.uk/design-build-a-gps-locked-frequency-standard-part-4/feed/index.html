		<description><![CDATA[Hi mr scully,
Recently i found this youtube channel an enjoy your way if explaning the projects.
so is start with the GPS frequency standard.
The GPS and arduio are bought recently.
Question, do yoy sell the PCB ?
I do not have the opportunity to make the PCB myself.
thanks 
regards, 
William (PE1BZF)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good evening Louis,
I am going to built this GPS frequency standard and I would like to avoid to use a back-up battery. 
as you said that &quot;if a NEO-7N is purchased you do not need a back-up battery&quot; I would like to use a NEO-7N (or a M8N) module.  
but looking at the pictures of the boards which use the 7N (and also M8N) I can see that the high value capacitor is still there! so what is its purpose?
and what is the difference between a NEO-7N and a NEO-M8N?

best regards

		<description><![CDATA[I seem to have lost the plot on what all the jumpers were intended for in this project; I can&#039;t seem to find any past reference to the purpose of each one. For my application It looks like I can simply remove all the jumpers (ie short them all out)?

Not entirely sure what JP4/5/6 are doing (i&#039;m using a std keypad, not a membrane)?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The project is a bit slow-going here (too many actually !) but I did buy a keypad similar to your design but just as an aside; what exactly is the difference between a &quot;keypad&quot; and a &quot;membrane keypad&quot;? I naively imagined they would have the same pin-out..... but of course not !!

I&#039;ve decided that since the physics of my design are going to be substantially different to your layout that I might just as well use veroboard and do it the hard way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Louis,
I am starting the process of building this project. I will be attempting to make a few changes, to accommodate my skill sets:
- Use of a PIC18F4550 microcontroller. Google &quot;PIC 18F Pinquino&quot;
- Use of the chips PLL, to calm jitters
- Use the chip&#039;s memory, instead of a separate EEPROM
- Use of C Code
- Use of all 3.3 volt components, to reduce power usage and give better battery life.

3.3 volt, 1602 character displays are available on Ebay. You need to specify the voltage, in the search terms and read the description, carefully. I have had good experiences, with this seller:
https://www.ebay.com/itm/DC-3-3V-HD44780-1602-LCD-Display-Module-16x2-Character-LCM-Blue-Blacklight-NEW/191563253688?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&#038;_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649

I have ordered some of the larger components. The GPS module has arrived. At 3.3 volts, I was able to configure it (thanks to your great tutorial, in Episode #1) and fully acquire a signal lock. I used this USB to TTL Converter:
https://www.banggood.com/3_3V-5V-USB-to-TTL-Converter-CH340G-UART-Serial-Adapter-Module-STC-p-1232728.html?rmmds=myorder&#038;cur_warehouse=CN

Care must be taken, when using this converter. The converter is not intended to power the DUT, from the limited laptop USB supply. DMM testing of the open positive pin (See Jumper) shows that it is the inverse voltage of the programming logic level... 5 volts on unused jumper/power pin, at 3.3v logic... 3.3 volts on unused jumper/power pin, at 5v logic. Meaning the use of the jumper is not intended to make power available, from the unused jumper pin. Therefore, the DUT/GPS needs its own power supply.

I believe that, regardless of the DUT&#039;s/GPS&#039;s power source, the grounds need to be tied, to enable programming. The converter is tied to earth, through the laptop. I used my bench PSU and configured to it leave the ground floating. This setup worked well and I did not toast anything.

This is the proper RP-SMA (The &quot;RP&quot; designation is important) connector, to attach the powered antenna directly to the PCB:
https://www.ebay.com/itm/10pcs-RP-SMA-Female-Plug-Bulkhead-Solder-Edge-PCB-Clip-Mount-RF-Connector-zg/232697419551?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&#038;_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649

This is the powered antenna I purchased:
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LHKKJY4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&#038;psc=1

This is my GPS unit:
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y2P5NST/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&#038;psc=1
If I were to do it again, I would order the bare receiver, without a passive antenna, as you need to order a powered antenna, anyway. That will save you a couple of dollars.

Anyway, I listed the parts, because they all worked together, correctly, at the desired 3.3 volts.

I know that this will be a very long-term project, for me. But, I will post updates and the final project, when completed.

If anyone would like to work on this, with me, please reply. Maybe we can get Louis to forward our contact information,  to each other, without posting it publicly.

Thanks, so much!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kevin,
I double check my email to you. I did use the correct email address, may be it is in your spam mail due to the fact that I added 2 zip files.
Anyway as long as you have the files you wanted from my download links here.
Regards,
Louis]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks heaps Louis.
I never received your email (you may have left out the &quot;g&quot; in the middle), but I have successfully downloaded the files from your links.
I have ordered the PCB&#039;s to be manufactured.
Still needing enough time to assemble your DC voltage calibrator, but will get to that shortly.
Thanks again for your very fast response, and my very best wishes for the future.
I will remain &quot;glued&quot; to your channel for as long as it exists.
Kindest regards,   Kevin.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kevin,
I sent you an email with the gerber files and also the KiCad files for the latest double sided PCB (with no wire links required). I have alos made them available as downloads from the links below:
http://www.scullcom.com/GPS_Disciplined_Oscillator_Gerber_Files.zip
The PCB size is 100mm x 160mm

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Louis,
I have been following your excellent projects for some time now, and am in the process of building the DC Voltage Calibrator and the GPS locked Frequency Reference. Do you have available the Gerber production files for the GPS Freq Ref. project ?  I downloaded them for the DC Calibrator and had the pcb commercially manufactured, but it has been some time since I made my own boards photographically. Maybe you could email them to me if available, or post them as a link.
Keep up the fantastic projects and support videos. All the best - Kevin Pearce.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Nigel,
You should be able to get one from Farnells. There order code for the 4x4 Button Keypad is 1182239. Direct link below:
http://uk.farnell.com/multicomp/mcak1604nbwb/keypad-4x4-array-0-02a-24vdc-plastic/dp/1182239?st=matrix%20keypad
They are also available on eBay much cheaper - one example is the link below:
