		<description><![CDATA[Hi Lewis

Only thing I can think of is try reprogramming the arduino nano as this appears to be the 
brains of the operation or try exchanging it if you have another to hand.
Failing that I would check for bad connections etc.

Regards

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Louis for another Great project. Just finished putting mine together and all works great up to 8v, however anything over 8v and up to 10v only gives me around 8v .
Im using a Keysight U1272A auto ranging DMM. I did use 16v Tantalum Caps for C2 and C14 but have since changed those to the Required 25V tantalum Caps. after I changed these I got 10V but then it collapsed back to the 8V.
Any Suggestions would be greatly appreciated from anyone.


Thanks for all your great Projects]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The ACT variants of the voltage regulators are now obsolete, upshot of this is that the replacement for the LM7815ACT has a minimum input voltage of 23V along with all the other variants I have come across.

Kind of stuck on how to progress this project now ( I&#039;m a beginner ).....]]></description>
