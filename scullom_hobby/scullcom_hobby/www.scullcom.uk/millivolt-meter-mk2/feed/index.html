		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I need help!
I have created a perf board variation of the mk2 millivolt meter and it doesn&#039;t work.  I have placed a pdf of the circuit board layout in the link below.

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WF7aGF4wwLYKMQYC_pfe-S47Mx0pNHwQ

The 3 smd ics, are mounted to smd to dip adapters to make it compatible with 2.54mm pitch perf board.  The AD8628 is a SOT23 package, the ADR4540 &#038; LTC2400 are both 8 pin.
The 10 to 1 voltage divider is created using 6 x 232K 0.1% resistors in a series + parallel (3R, R/3) layout, give 696K &#038; 77.333K network.

The connections to the arduino nano are made via pin headers.

So the circuit / software runs but the voltage reading is wrong and inconsistent, ie 5V displays as anything between 5V and 1050V.
If you calibrate it to a 5v reference it gives a calibration offset of around 4200.

Without the op amp buffer connected, the 4.096V reference from the ADR4540 can be measured as 4.096V, with the op amp connected it measures around 0.83V.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Julian,
Thanks for your kind comments.
With regards your questions:
1. Yes you can use the internal 4.096V reference for calibration.
2. The new small PCB used in Mk2 was designed by one of my viewers who for some reason designed his print layout to use the 900K / 100K divider of the Caddock Resistor Networks. Originally I used the 9M / 1M option. You can use either but the latter option gives you a higher input impedance which is better. To use the 9M / 1M option on the new Mk2 PCB (from OSH Park) you will need to raise the Caddock Resistor Networks off the PCB slightly and then use wires connecting the 9M / 1M sections to the PCB.
I am currently working on a new project which will be a Function Generator with some new design features. I am currently designing a PCB for this new project. Hopefully, I shall have it finished in a few weeks and will film it for my You Tube channel.
Kind regards,
Louis]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

First of all can I just say &quot;don&#039;t stop making these projects videos&quot;.
I&#039;m returning to hobby electronics after a 25 or so year break and things have changed a lot, so my learning curve is very steep at the moment and your videos are, in my opinion, some of the best on you tube.

I have been following the millivolt meter project and I have a couple of questions I hope you can answer for me.
1. The mk2 version uses an external 5v reference for calibration, can the internal 4.096v reference be used instead?  i.e a switched connection between the output of the ic and the +ve input on the board. 
2. The mk2 version uses the same caddock resistor network as used in the earlier versions, but the divider has been reduced from 9M / 1M to 900k / 100k is there an advantage?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Full disclosure: It takes me 1.5 hours to watch &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. 
But isn&#039;t what your are describing called a multi-meter?  and what about a  capacitance meter that can test leakage and ESR?
Also now we are making this I want to add the following features please:
Continuity, Conductance, Inductence, Temperature, Diode and Transistor.

And less important but still would be liked: 
Decibel, Duty cycle and Frequency.

Now I don&#039;t know David Smith, but I&#039;m willing to go out on a limb and say both he and I are willing to pay up to $82.98 USD for such a device. Louis how long will it take you to design this and share with us? in the mean time I&#039;m going to go door knocking to find additional buyers]]></description>
