		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scullcom,
My Name is Jamie and  I am so new to electronics &#038; programming its not funny. I am a 12V &#038; 240V electrician. I am interested in something a little new &#038; thought a little electronics project would be fun. I&#039;ve been watching your youtube videos &#038; they are very interesting &#038; you seem very knowledgeable in this field. Saying this it seems a little out of my league without doing some course.

I am really interested in the &quot;simple GPS system arduino mini &#038; OLED display&quot; to start with.

I was wondering if it could be configured to read kilometer readings &#038; if so , could it also store the kilometer readings so they accumulate over time eg. in a years time or so you could see how many kilometers you&#039;ve accumulated over this time?

My email streetiesurf@hotmail.com

Thank you so much for your time
