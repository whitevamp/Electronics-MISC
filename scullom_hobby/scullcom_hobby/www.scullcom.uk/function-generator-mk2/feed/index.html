		<description><![CDATA[Hi Louis I hope that you are well?
Is there any chance of you providing the psu details?
I have no means of powering the unit to carry out the initial set-up.
Hope to see you back soon.

Regards
Mark.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Louis,

Thanks for always making great videos. I love that everyone&#039;s concerned about you not posting in a while -but good to see you&#039;re just busy with family projects.

Just wondering if you had an email address I could grab? Really want to run something by you.

Thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mark,

Thanks for your comments. I am sure you could add a function to the Battery Capacity mode so that it could be used to check supper capacitors. I may have a look at adding it as an option later.

At the moment I am busy with some family projects.

Best regards,

Louis]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Louis,
I know this is off the Function Generator Mk2 subject but I hadn&#039;t seen any recent activity on the Electronic DC Load section, of which it seems I was late to the party.  I was hoping you could answer a question on it.  I wanted to know if you thought your DC load unit software could be modified or added to, in order to measure farads for supercapacitor experiments?  These are generally low voltage but rated in a few to many farads.  My software experience is 8085 assembly but that was about 30 years ago but it seems to me it could be done by data logging amperage and also the voltage rise until it tops out and then do the capacitance calculations.

Thank you for your time]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glad your ok, spare time I&#039;m told in retirement most are more busy than when at work, with only 12 months to go I&#039;m wondering what&#039;s in store. I sometimes don&#039;t have the drive to go into my workshop for a couple of months, then I&#039;ll just go in and spend all day in there. Wow writing a book if it&#039;s going to be published let me know please nothing nicer than a good book to read.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Paul,
Thanks for your message. I have been busy of late with other work so have not had much spare time for my YouTube channel. I am in the process of writing a book about family history which is taking longer than I first thought. Hope to get back to electronics projects soon.
Best regards,
Louis]]></description>
