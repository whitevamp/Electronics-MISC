		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kenneth,

All the links are usually available below my videos on YouTube, you may have to click on the SHOW MORE link below my initial comments to see all the download links.
You will see the following text below Part 1 video:

In this project we will design and build a 10MHz GPS locked frequency standard with additional
outputs of 1MHz, 100KHz, 10KHz, 1KHz and 100Hz. The output frequency will also be present even
when no satellite lock is available but will be free running. We will use a Arduino Nano and LCD
SHOW MORE

Simply click on the SHOW MORE and you will see all the links for that video.

Hope this helps.

Best regards,

Louis]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am going to build the GPS Frequency Standard you have designed.

In your videos, you will sometimes say the artwork is in a link listed below the video.  I guess I&#039;m dense, I don&#039;t see any links to anything.  Where are these links you talk about.  I am interested in the main pbc and the other board that you mount the 3 ICs on.

Thanks.  I have about 10 years experience in electronics and I have learned more from watching your vids!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello again Louis,
       So I bought a couple of 7M modules, and a couple of Nanos, but unfortunately I have had to abandon the project.  The electronics are simple enough, (thanks to integration!) but the software is impossible!
     No matter how many copies of TinyGPS.h I sprinkle in likely places the Arduino IDE refuses to find any of them. All my programming has been in assembly language (X86 or PIC). I don&#039;t like slow, bulky &quot;high level&quot; languages,and it is far to late in life to start learning what I think is C. The Arduino error messages are simply beyond my understanding.

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Louis.
      I now know that I have bought the wrong Module  (6M)!
Even so I enjoyed your presentation. For what little it may be worth, I think that it was superbly done.
