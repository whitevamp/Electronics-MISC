		<description><![CDATA[Hi Louis

Can you do a tutorial on negative power supplies and op-amps please? Although I am nearing retirement age I have been learning about electronics for the last couple of years. I wish I had &quot;gotten into&quot; electronics a lot sooner as I really enjoy the subject. I do understand op-amps a bit but am struggling with negative power supplies.

regards

Martin]]></description>
