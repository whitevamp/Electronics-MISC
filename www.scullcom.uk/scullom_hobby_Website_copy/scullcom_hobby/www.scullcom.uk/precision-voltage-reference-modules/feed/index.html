		<description><![CDATA[This was an outstanding presentation. I had just bought one of these, the KKMOON in the plastic box, and was very interested in your description of what was in it. Since then I have wasted several hours trying to learn more about the band gap voltage reference used on the AD584-M chip, but I will need to first read a good book on solid state physics.
You have an impressive shop and are a good instructor. Thank you
