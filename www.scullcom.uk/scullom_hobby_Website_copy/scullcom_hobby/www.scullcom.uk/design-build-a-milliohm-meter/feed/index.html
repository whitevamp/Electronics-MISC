		<description><![CDATA[Hint, to measure the 1.25V of the LT1634 the source output has to be shorted or a small (less than 2Ohm) resistor connected! I had a fault too. I used three 4.7Ohm 0,1% resistors in series instead of 4 56Ohm in parallel. but it didn&#039;t work. Until I realized, that I have been sent 4.7k resistors, labeled as 4.7Ohm. Took me some time. So carefully check the resistors too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apply a small voltage i.e. from a 1.5V battery to the input of the panel-meter. Desolder the input wires from the PCB frst! Do you get a reading of about 1.5? If so, the panel-meter is ok. Solder the wires back to the PCB. Apply a small voltage (less than 200mv = 0,2V, use a 1:10 divider with the 1.5V battery) to the sense input of the pcb. Do you get a reading on the panel-meter? If not, inspect the sense part. Are the supply voltages for the INA present? +/-10V as generated by the MAX680? With shorted sense input you should be able to adjust the reading to zero, using the 100k trimmer. If you have been able to adjust the source part to 100mA, this part should be ok. To be sure, measure the voltage from pin 6 to pin 4 of the LT1634. You should get 1.25V with very litte deviation. Hope this helps.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I like your website and the youtube channel very much and already built some stuff (i.e. current box, milliohm meter). All working very good. I ordered 3 MilliOhmMeter PCB‘s from OshPark v1.5. If someone is interested, 2 are left over. I‘m from germany, so delivery within germany would be preferred (or europe) not overseas, too expensive I think. 7€ plus shipping.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Louis,
I looked through the whole project and i did not see a complete schematic diagram.
I would like to look and study the schematic before, then i will order the PCB and parts.
I want ot understand how it works.
I am a visual person and looking at at schematic is better than reading.
By the way, who drive your LCD display.
I did not see any microprocessor on your drawings.
Please reply to my email because i might miss your reply here.
Thank you
Ion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Louis,

This project gets better and better. Good work!

I have a possible alternative for the precision resistors.
Both the Welwyn RC55Y series (at 2.56 Euro&#039;s a piece) and the Holsworthy H856 series (at 1.72 Euro&#039;s each) are pretty expensive. Greg ordered a high number of  0.25 cent 1% 50PPM/K resistors (100 for the 56R2 and 20 of the 63R4) resistors and did his own matching to get near the precision of 0,1% and 15PPM/C. However, Mouser has the NEOHM YR1B series with the required precision (0.1%) and a TC of 15 PPM/C for only 0.25 Euro&#039;s in single quantities for all the required resistors (63R4, 56R2, 100R, 499K and 10R). Digikey has them too, but only in minimum quantities of 1,000 pieces. There are only 8 resistors required, but when you&#039;re on a tight budget and can get them all for the price of one...]]></description>
