		<description><![CDATA[Hi, sadly the Intersil ISL21009BFB850 has now been discontinued. It is an obsolete part. The ISL21090 is the closest replacement that I could find. Can that be made to work? Are there any alternatives?

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Louis,
Really enjoying your video Projects and look forward to whats coming next.
I was wondering if you could give me some guidance,I just built the Precision Voltage referenence and as my local store didnt have the right Chokes  have used 330uH chokes,Not sure if thats causing my problem though.I am getting around 14.3v and -13.7volts from the test points of the IC and only the 5v on the rotary switch is right,I am getting 1.21v on th 100mA,3,928 on the 1V and 4.986 on the 10V.I thought I may have had the switch in the wrong way but that seems to only fit one way.
Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks for excellent series once again
Regards
