				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An OP Amp or Operational Amplifier is a differential input, single ended output amplifier. The gain of these amplifiers is determined by an external feedback element which is usually a resistor network. The symbol for a OP Amp is below:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-226" src="http://www.scullcom.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OP_Amp_Symbol.jpg" alt="OP_Amp_Symbol" width="577" height="522" srcset="http://www.scullcom.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OP_Amp_Symbol.jpg 577w, http://www.scullcom.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OP_Amp_Symbol-300x271.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px" /></p>
<p>The name “Operational Amplifier” originated from the fact that devices of this design were originally used in analog computers to help perform mathematical operations such as addition, multiplication, and many more.</p>
<p>An <strong>ideal</strong> OP Amp has the following attributes:</p>
<p>Infinite open-loop gain.<br />
Zero input offset voltage.<br />
Infinite input impedance, and therefore zero input current.<br />
Infinite voltage range available at the output.<br />
Infinite bandwidth with zero phase shift and infinite slew rate.<br />
Zero output impedance.<br />
Zero noise.<br />
Infinite Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR)<br />
Infinite Power Supply Rejection Ratio.</p>
<p>These ideals may be summarised by the two &#8220;Key Rules&#8221; which should be remembered:</p>
<p>1. In a closed loop the output attempts to do whatever is necessary to make the voltage difference between the inputs zero.<br />
2. The inputs draw no current.</p>
<p>Internally, the op amp is basically a three-stage amplifier circuit using multiple transistors. The three stages are as follows:</p>
<p>1. A differential stage that makes a comparison of the two input voltage signals and outputs the amplified difference value.</p>
<p>2 A high gain stage that receives the differential stage output and amplifies it further.</p>
<p>3. An output buffer stage that may also serve as a “power amplifier” stage for driving large capacitive or resistive loads and for providing a low output impedance.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-231" src="http://www.scullcom.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OP_Amp_topology.jpg" alt="OP_Amp_topology" width="792" height="182" srcset="http://www.scullcom.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OP_Amp_topology.jpg 792w, http://www.scullcom.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OP_Amp_topology-300x69.jpg 300w, http://www.scullcom.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OP_Amp_topology-768x176.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px" /></p>
<p>The input impedance of an Op Amp is made to be very high so that very little current flows (ideally no current) in the signal inputs, and thus any preceding circuit providing the input signal has very little load imposed upon it and very little power is consumed.</p>
<p>Unlike other signal boosting amplifier circuits, the Op Amp circuit uses no coupling capacitors at the input or output terminals. This direct coupling method allows the Op Amp to work with both DC and AC voltages.</p>
<p>The voltage gain of an Op Amp in an “Open Loop” configuration (i.e. no output feedback is provided) is typically very high, in the range of 10,000 to 100,000, and some may even exceed 1,000,000. For most circuit application a closed loop configuration is used in which feedback to an input terminal is provided from the output using a resistor network.</p>

Basic Inverting Amplifier</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-233" src="http://www.scullcom.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Inverting_op_amp_gain.jpg" alt="Inverting_op_amp_gain" width="743" height="650" srcset="http://www.scullcom.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Inverting_op_amp_gain.jpg 743w, http://www.scullcom.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Inverting_op_amp_gain-300x262.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px" /><br />
In the above circuit the input impedance is almost equal to the resistance of R2, since one side of this resistor always remains at about ground potential. To minimise the effect of small currents flowing in to the amplifier inputs the value of R3 should equal the value of R2 in parallel with R1.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Basic Non-Inverting Amplifier circuit</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-234" src="http://www.scullcom.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Non_inverting_op_amp_gain.jpg" alt="Non_inverting_op_amp_gain" width="663" height="517" srcset="http://www.scullcom.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Non_inverting_op_amp_gain.jpg 663w, http://www.scullcom.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Non_inverting_op_amp_gain-300x234.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Op Amp Buffer</strong><br />
<strong>(voltage follower with 100% negative feedback)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-full wp-image-235 aligncenter" src="http://www.scullcom.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OP_amp_buffer.jpg" alt="OP_amp_buffer" width="663" height="517" srcset="http://www.scullcom.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OP_amp_buffer.jpg 663w, http://www.scullcom.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/OP_amp_buffer-300x234.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px" /><br />
The voltage follower above is sometimes called an &#8220;impedance converter&#8221; as it converts the high input impedance to a low output impedance.</p>
<p><strong>OP AMP TOPOLOGIES</strong></p>
<p>The above circuit examples relate to voltage feedback Op Amps but there are two basic Op Amp topologies, namely; voltage feedback and current feedback.</p>

<p><strong>RESISTOR TYPES<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Carbon Composition</strong></p>
<p>These are general purpose resistors with excellent transient and surge handling capabilities. The resistance value of this type can increase by as much as 20% during storage or humid conditions. Resistance values can be found up to 100 MΩ. The typical temperature coefficient can be between -200 to -8000 ppm/°C. and noise is usually below 6μV/V. Typical tolerance ratings range from 5% to 20%.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon Film</strong></p>
<p>These are also general purpose resistors but cost less than Carbon Composition type and usually are available in values from 10Ω to 25MΩ. These are usually available in tolerance ratings of 2% to 10% and have a temperature coefficient of between -200 to -1000 ppm/°C. Noise level is usually better than 10μV/V.</p>
<p><strong>Metal Film</strong></p>
<p>These type are high stability with long life and excellent HF performance. They have a fair degree of precision at low resistance values. The resistance value is stable to around 100MHz but fall off at higher frequencies. This type of resistor is ideal for use in measuring circuits, filters and HF tuning circuits. They are available in tolerances of 0.01% to 20% and have a temperature coefficient of ±25 to ±175 ppm/°C with noise levels of only 0.1μV/V.</p>
<p><strong>Metal oxide film</strong></p>
<p>Metal-oxide film resistors are made of metal oxides this results in a higher operating temperature and greater stability/reliability than Metal film type. These are usually used in military grade equipment where high endurance demands are required.</p>
<p><strong>Film Network</strong></p>
<p>Similar to Metal Film in performance and are available in either Thick or Thin Film (or Metal Film) types. Thick Film are manufactured using screen and stencil printing processes and most SMD (surface mount device) resistors today are of this type. Thin film resistors are made by sputtering (a method of vacuum deposition) the resistive material onto an insulating substrate. The film is then etched in a similar manner to that used in making printed circuit boards; that is, the surface is coated with a photo-sensitive material, then covered by a pattern film, irradiated with ultraviolet light, and then the exposed photo-sensitive coating is developed, and underlying thin film is etched away. The resistance of both thick and thin film resistors after manufacture is not highly accurate; they are usually trimmed to an accurate value by abrasive or laser trimming. Thin film resistors have tolerances of 0.1% to 1% with temperature coefficient of 50ppm/°C (high precision Thin Film available with 0.05% with temperature coefficient of 5ppm/°C). Thick film resistors have tolerances usually of 0.5% to 2%.</p>
<p><strong>Foil resistor</strong></p>
<p>The primary resistance element of a foil resistor is a special alloy foil several micrometers thick. Foil resistors usually have the best precision and stability of any resistor available. The temperature coefficient of foil resistors is extremely low. The tolerance of this type resistor is usually ±0.005%. Foil resistors have temperature coefficient of 0.2ppm/°C (long-term stability (after 1 year) 25 ppm, (after 3 years) 50 ppm.). Some ultra-precision foil resistors offers a temperature coefficient of 0.14 ppm/°C.</p>
<p><strong>Wirewound</strong></p>
<p>Wirewound resistors are commonly made by winding a metal wire, usually nichrome, around a ceramic, plastic, or fiberglass core.</p>
<p><strong>Precision Wirewound</strong></p>
<p>Precision wirewound resistors consist of resistance wire wound on a plastic or ceramic bobbin. The wire is spot welded to outside copper leads and epoxy molded to protect it from the outside environment. They have tolerances ranging from ±0.005% and temperature coefficient of 3ppm/°C.</p>
